SciDAC QLA C interface -- Level 1 linear algebra routines

This package uses the standard GNU configuration script.  See the file
INSTALL for datails on compiling and installing.  It is recommended that
QLA be compiled with a C99 compliant compiler (or at least one that
understands the restrict keyword).  Check your compiler documentation to
find the appropriate option (for gcc try -std=c99 or for xlc try
-qlanglvl=stdc99).

Some configuration options to be aware of are:
 --enable-sse	uses optimized SSE routines for some functions (P4 single)
 --enable-sse2	uses optimized SSE2 routines for some functions (P4 double)
 --enable-440	uses optimized 440 routines for some functions (QCDOC/BGL)
 --enable-nc=[2,3,n]	build only the 2, 3, or arbitrary (n) color libraries
			leave this out to build all libraries

Right now the SSE code requires gcc version < 4.0.  The compiler used for
the SSE code can be specified separately from the compiler used for the
rest of the library.  This is done with the GNUCC environment variable.
An example configure command is:

configure \
  --prefix=$HOME/scidac/install/qla \
  --enable-nc=3 \
  --enable-sse2 \
  CC=gcc \
  CFLAGS="-std=c99 -O3 -march=pentium4" \
  GNUCC=gcc-3.4

Documentation is included in the doc directory.  This is not included in
the installation.  See the README file in the doc directory for details.
