SciDAC QLA C interface -- Level 1 linear algebra routines

This package uses the standard GNU configuration script.  See the file
INSTALL for datails on compiling and installing.  It is recommended that
QLA be compiled with a C99 compliant compiler (or at least one that
understands the restrict keyword).  Check your compiler documentation to
find the appropriate option (for gcc try -std=c99 or for xlc try
-qlanglvl=stdc99).

Documentation is included in the doc directory.  This is not included in
the installation.  See the README file in the doc directory for details.
