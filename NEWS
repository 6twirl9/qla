SciDAC QLA C interface
===========================================================================
Version 1.5.0
November 30, 2005

Some functions involving the eqm, peq, and meq varieties of global sums
have been removed.  Use the eq form and then accumulate separately.
===========================================================================
Version 1.4
November 10, 2005

See Changelog for changes.
Note that the internal layout for some fields has changed so all codes
linking to QLA should be recompiled for this version.
===========================================================================
Version 1.3
April 27, 2005

Rearranged directories to have a top level lib and include.
Now available from Jlab CVS.
===========================================================================
Version 1.2
September 4, 2003

This is the third beta release of the QLA C library.  Again it has passed
many tests and is coming closer to having a stable interface.

The major changes are:
1.	Conversion to use autoconf and automake.
2.	Inclusion of a few optimized routines for specific architectures.
3.	A few new functions (see ChangeLog for details).
===========================================================================
Version 1.1
February 4, 2003

This is a second beta release of the QLA C library.  Like version 1.0
it has passed a battery of tests, but should still be used with caution.

The major changes are:
1.	Dropped the equivalent Gauge and StaggeredPropagator types and
	consolidated to a "ColorMatrix" type with type code "M" (which
	was previously used for StaggeredPropagator).
2.	Changed StaggeredFermion to ColorVector.
3.	A new long double type with code "Q" has been introduced.
	This is currently only used in a small set of functions.
4.	Several more new or changed functions.  See the ChangeLog file
	for a detailed list.
===========================================================================
Version 1.0
November 10, 2002

This is the first beta release of the QLA C library.  It has passed a
battery of tests, but should be used with caution in production running
until we have had more experience with it.

Code generation is done through Perl scripts.  The most
straightforward workable code is produced with no particular effort
made to help the compiler with optimization.

Future releases will feature selected performance tests.
