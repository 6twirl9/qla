Authors of QLA
==============

The QLA API was designed as a part of the National Computational
Infrastructure for Lattice Gauge Theory (http://www.lqcd.org/).
Many members of the Software Committee contributed to the design.

The main part of the library, test suite and documentation was written by
Carleton Detar <detar@physics.utah.edu>.  The conversion to use autoconf
and automake along with other modifications and the inclusion of the
optimized routines was done by James Osborn <josborn@physics.bu.edu>.
